> Autocomplete selected Emoji when submitting forms on GitHub.com.


When leaving comments, opening issues etc. you can use
`:emoji:`. That's pretty neat. But often, it happened
to me to write the comment and add an emoji at the end.
So, I was writing my comment and adding the emoji.
But since I was seeing the selected emoji, I pressing
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> to submit my comment
and obviously the result was looking like: *bla, bla,
bla :emoji* (notice the missing closing colon).

This userscript will take care of my emoji to be
submitted as well when submitting the form while
the emoji suggestion list is opened. :tada: :fireworks:

## :sparkling_heart: Support my projects

I open-source almost everything I can, and I try to reply everyone needing help using these projects. Obviously,
this takes time. You can integrate and use these projects in your applications *for free*! You can even change the source code and redistribute (even resell it).

However, if you get some profit from this or just want to encourage me to continue creating stuff, there are few ways you can do it:

 - Starring and sharing the projects you like :rocket:
 - [![Buy me a book][badge_amazon]][amazon]—I love books! I will remember you after years if you buy me one. :grin: :book:
 - [![PayPal][badge_paypal]][paypal-donations]—You can make one-time donations via PayPal. I'll probably buy a ~~coffee~~ tea. :tea:
 - [![Support me on Patreon][badge_patreon]][patreon]—Set up a recurring monthly donation and you will get interesting news about what I'm doing (things that I don't share with everyone).
 - **Bitcoin**—You can send me bitcoins at this address (or scanning the code below): `1P9BRsmazNQcuyTxEqveUsnf5CERdq35V6`
